# STPD-index

This repository contains an implementation of the **Suffix Tree Path Decomposition** index (`STPD-index`).

### Requirements

The `STPD-index` tool requires
* A Linux or MacOS 64-bit operating system.
* A modern C++11\14 compiler such as `g++` version 4.9 or higher.

### Usage

You can construct the STPD-index by using the `build_store_stpd_index` executable:
```
build_store_stpd_index [options]
Options:
-h          Print usage info.
-i <arg>    Input text file path. (REQUIRED)
-l <arg>    RLZ reference sequence length (if known). (Def. None)
-o <arg>    Output index file path. (REQUIRED)
```
The current implementation is **optimized for the DNA alphabet**; therefore, the input text must contain only DNA characters (A, C, G, T) and should be provided in ASCII format. <br>
Note that the current path decomposition algorithm computes the explicit suffix tree; therefore, the software **has been tested on small input files** up to a few gigabytes in size.

You can query the STPD-index by using the `locate` executable:
```
locate [options]
Options:
-h          Print usage info.
-i <arg>    Input index filepath. (REQUIRED)
-p <arg>    Patterns FASTA file.  (REQUIRED)
-t <arg>    Maximum number of occurrences to report per pattern. (Def. none)
```
This executable runs **locate all occurrences** queries for all patterns in the file specified with the `-p` option. The pattern file must be provided in FASTA format. The `-t` flag allows you to set the maximum number of occurrences to report for each pattern.
The **output is written to a file named after the pattern file**, with the `.occs` extension.

### Run on Example Data

```console
// Construct the STPD-index
./build/sources/stpd-index-src/build_store_stpd_index -i toy_data/yeast.txt -o toy_data/yeast.ci

// Run locate all occurrence queries using the STPD-index
./build/sources/stpd-index-src/locate -i toy_data/yeast.ci -p toy_data/yeast_patt_100.fasta
```
